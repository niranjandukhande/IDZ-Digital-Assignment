# ðŸŽˆ Balloon Burst â€“ Internship Assignment

This is a game prototype built as part of an internship assignment. The goal of the assignment was to simulate an interactive balloon experience: the user pumps air into a balloon, causing it to grow. Once filled, the balloon floats randomly around the screen, and the user can tap it to burst.
